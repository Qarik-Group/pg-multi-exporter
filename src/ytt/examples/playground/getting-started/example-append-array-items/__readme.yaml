  =====================
  Appending Array Items
  =====================

  Map items are easy to match: if the key of the "left" and
  the key of the "right" are equal, we can assume they
  refer to the same item. Lemon squeezy, default behavior.

  Array items don't have keys; they are referenced by index.
  We can not assume two items at the same position in the
  array refer to the same item.

  In ytt, you must specify how to match array items. Do this
  using the same `#@overlay/match by=...` annotation used on
  documents.

  So, all of these operations must be paired with a
  `@overlay/match`:

  - `@overlay/merge`
  - `@overlay/replace`
  - `@overlay/remove`
  - `@overlay/insert`

  The one exception is `@overlay/append` which ignores any
  `@overlay/match` and always inserts after the last item.

  ------------------------
  Append vs. Ensure Exists
  ------------------------

  `append-https-port.yml` showcases how to add new array
  items.

  Explore:
  1. Summarize what this overlay does in a sentence.

  2. Examine the output of `config/service.yml`; what's
     wrong there? (hint: ports must be unique)

  3. Just above `#@overlay/append` _add_ the following:
     ```
     #@overlay/remove
     #@overlay/match by="name", missing_ok=True
     - name: https
     ```

     How does `config/service.yml` look?

  4. Does the same possibility exist for the `Deployment`?

  Thinking in ytt:

  "Overlays apply not to collections, but items:

             not docsets, documents;
                          not maps, map items;
                                    not arrays, array items."
